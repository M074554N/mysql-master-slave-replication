# Mysql master/slave replication

This is a sample Master/Slave replication using MySQL on Docker

## How to use?
You have to have docker engine latest version (or at least version `19.03.0+`) and `docker-compose`. If you are using Mac or Windows, you should have `docker-compose` available with your docker installation, but if you're using Linux you might want to download it.

#### Follow the steps

- `git clone https://github.com/M074554N/mysql-master-slave-replication.git`
- `cd mysql-master-slave-replication`
- `docker-compose up -d`

Wait for 60 seconds until all containers are started and setup and then you are good to go.
